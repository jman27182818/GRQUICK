# GRQUICK
A Mathematica Package to symbolically manipulate quantities/tensors in General Relativity.

GRQUICK is a Mathematica package designed to quickly and easily calculate/manipulate relevant tensors in general relativity. Given an NxN metric and an N-dimensional coordinate vector, GRQUICK can calculate the: Christoffel symbols, Riemann Tensor, Ricci Tensor, Ricci Scalar, and Einstein Tensor.

Along with calculating the above tensors, GRQUICK can be used to: manipulate four vectors in curved space, define tensors, display the geodesic equations, take covariant derivatives of tensors, and plot geodesics.

See the example notebook for specific notation on tensors.
